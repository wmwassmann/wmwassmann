### Summary

My personal GitHub - which has only recently seen a resurgence in productive commits. I used my company GitHub while at BillGO and most of my projects were company owned side projects. 

A new personal Website is in development https://wmwassmann.github.io/master/. It is currently in progress but this is a sneak peak for anyone who is interested

Open for work, searching for an mid level position to contribute skills learned during my two years at BillGO, Inc, and The University of Washington's Coding Bootcamp. Collaboration, communication, and problem solving with flexibility to meet the companies needs.
